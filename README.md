## This app is a fairly simple "dating-style" app

###### Take a quick 10 question survey and (in theory) your results will get compared to those who have already taken the survey.  The system compares your answers to others, and will determine the smallest difference between you and another person, and will display a modal with that person's name and a picture of them.  Again, in theory that is what's going on here.    

###### The app is not done, there are issues posting data to the api as well as working with response objects.  At best, this half works.  Routing works fairly well, but back-end logic continues to trouble me.
